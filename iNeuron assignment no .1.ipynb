    "String    :-  Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. Ex -‘string’\n",

    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer :-  Integer define as a number .There is effectively no limit to how long an integer value can be. Ex = 1,2,3,4,4,5\n",
    "Float :- Float define as a floating point number or decimal number. Ex = 0.2, 0.23 , 1.03\n",
    "Boolean :- Boolean data type has two values one True or second False . Ex= True , False\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.  All expressions evaluate (that is, reduce) to a single value.¬\n",

    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "¬¬Statement:-  A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We have only seen the assignment statement so far. Some other     kind ofstatemets that we’ll  see shortly are while statements, for statements, \n",

    "It show error because 99 is an integer and string concatenated only with other string not with integer values.\n",
